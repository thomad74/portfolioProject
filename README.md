##Project Name and Description

This project, `gator.py` creates a pop-up window on the screen of a set size and enters a green gator swimming through a blue body of water. The game simply allows the user to control the movements of the gator around the screen, imitating a gator swimming through a swamp. Additionally, I may try to add some functions that allow the gator to grow if it eats little fish, or die if it crashes into rocks or itself.

##How to Build and Run the Project

python3 gator.py

##How to Test the Application

Testing the application can be done using the `.travis.yml` file that checks the style and syntax of the program. The Travis CI build will ensure the program has the correct style and syntax, adn that it builds and runs correctly.
